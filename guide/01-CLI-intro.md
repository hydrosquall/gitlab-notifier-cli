# Intro to Node CLIs

What are your favorite CLI's?

## A quick CLI to run

```bash
npx swyx
```

You can see my business card here!

This is a trivial example but you can clone and publish your own: https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang

## NPM and CLI's

If you look at https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang, you'll see these fields in `package.json`:

```js
// https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang
  "main": "/bin/card.js", // primary entry point
  "bin": {
    "bitandbang": "./bin/card.js" // install this in the .bin folder as a CLI!
  },
  "files": [ // only package these files when publishing to npm, nice to have for smaller node_modules
    "bin/card.js",
    "bin/output"
  ],
```

And when you look into [`/bin/card.js`](https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang/blob/master/bin/card.js) you see this weird thing called a shebang:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
// ðŸ‘† Used to tell Node.js that this is a CLI tool

'use strict'

const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const output = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'output'), 'utf8')
console.log(output)
```

## Anatomy of a CLI

A minimum viable CLI can be a simple JS file:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log('hello world!')
```

*nix systems also require you to mark these files as executable before you run them:

```bash
chmod +x foo.js   # mark executable
./foo.js          # run the file
# hello world!
```

You can of course read arguments and require modules and do all sorts of interesting things:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
var myArgs = process.argv.slice(2);
console.log('myArgs: ', myArgs);
```

Then you may want to parse the arguments in a consistent way, provide help documentation, add TypeScript, add a plugin system, add a nice debugging developer experience...
