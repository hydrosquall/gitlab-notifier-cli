# gitlab-notifier-cli

A small CLI for getting desktop notifications when gitlab pipelines complete.

Completed as a learning exercise, practicing using OCLIF for make tools for personal productivity.

## Todo

- Bundle up with TSDX
- Publish to NPM
- Tests?
- Polish readme
- Deploy to NPM if build completes successfully

## Acknowledgements

- SWYX's OCLIF course on Egghead.io
- The Heroku team for open-sourcing OCLIF
- Gitlab for clearly documenting their API
